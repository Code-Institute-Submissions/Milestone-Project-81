BookSmart

My third milestone project is based on creating a site that will allow the user to record the books that they own and would like to buy.

UX 

User Stories

Below are user stories that were made so that I have a vision for my project:

As a user, I would like to store the books that I own on a online database.

As a user, I would like to store the books that I want to buy on a online database.

As a new user, I would like the site to be easy to use.

As a user, I would like to be able to add books with ease.

As a user, I would like to see the books that I have added.

As a user, I would like to be able to update any books or delete any books I have added.

Strategy
My plan for the site was to create an online system where the user can record the books they own and want to buy easily.

Scope
The site is to provide users who would like a online library to record the books they own and would like to buy by filling in a form with information on the book. The user is also able to delete any books they no longer own or would not like to buy anymore and edit information on the books they have added.

Structure
The main pages on the site is the my books and books to purchase section which will display the books that the users adds, when a book is added it will be displayed in a collapsible with edit and delete icons and the rating of the book the user gives to it. When the collapsible is clicked it will dropdown with the information on the book such as the author and the review from the user. When the users wants to add a book, he can just click on the add book links in the navbar which will take the user to the forms to add either a book they own or would like to buy. The add book forms will allow the user to fill in information about the book such as the title, author, year of release and genre, when the user adds a book they own they can also add a personal review and rating of the book in the form and if they are adding a book to purchase then instead in the form they can add why they want to buy the book and a link for the book to buy. When the edit icon is clicked, it will take the user to the same form as the add books form, but with the information already inputed and once the user has made the changes they want they can click update. When the delete icon is clicked in the collapsible it will bring up a modal which will confirm the deletion of the book.

Skeleton
Below are links to the wireframes for this project and are designed to include different versions for a desktop, tablet and mobile phone view.

Surface
The primary background color of site is dark blue which is in the header, footer and collapsible, but the navbar and sidenav background colour is light grey as I believe this offered the site a great balance. The color of all the text except for the forms is white and the font is Sriracha as it worked well with the page and the font is stylish but easily readable. There is a double border around the forms, which helps make it look like the book is a form.
